## 🚀 Getting Started (a.k.a. Summon the Dev Server)

Before you begin your epic coding journey, you gotta wake up the development server from its slumber. Here’s how you do it (pick your favorite spell):

```bash
npm run dev   # 🧙‍♂️ Summoning with npm
# or
yarn dev     # 🏹 Calling in Yarn warriors
# or
pnpm dev     # 🏗️ The pnpm builders at work
# or
bun dev      # 🍞 Baking with Bun
```

Then, hop over to your browser and visit [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) to witness your creation in action. 🎭

Now go forth, contribute, and make this website as awesome as your favorite cat GIF. 🐱✨

Happy coding! 💻🎉
