Hey there, awesome human!

Welcome to the **Hackerspace Mangaluru** official website repository—Mangaluru’s ultimate geeky playground! 🎉🤓 We host **tech talks, workshops, and events** (yes, free snacks sometimes 🍕👀) to spread knowledge and fuel innovation like butter on a sizzling hot dosa! 🧈🔥 So grab your keyboards, summon your inner coding wizard 🧙‍♂️, and let’s build something awesome together! 🚀😆

## 🤔 So, you wanna contribute?

Sweet! All changes to this website (including content, memes, and secret messages for future AI overlords 🤖) are made through **Pull Requests**. If you’re new to **Git** and **GitHub** and think a "pull request" is something you do when opening a really stubborn jar lid, don’t worry! We gotcha! Check out this **super friendly guide** on submitting your first PR at [gitme.js.org](https://gitme.js.org).

## 🚀 Getting Started (a.k.a. Summon the Dev Server)

Before you begin your epic coding journey, you gotta wake up the development server from its slumber. Here's how you do it (pick your favorite spell):

### 🛠️ Initial Setup (First Time Only)

```bash
# Install all the magical dependencies
npm install

# Build the project (optional but recommended)
npm run build
```

### 🧙‍♂️ Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev   # 🧙‍♂️ Summoning with npm
# or
yarn dev     # 🏹 Calling in Yarn warriors
# or
pnpm dev     # 🏗️ The pnpm builders at work
# or
bun dev      # 🍞 Baking with Bun
```

Then, hop over to your browser and visit [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) to witness your creation in action. 🎭

Now go forth, contribute, and make this website as awesome as your favorite cat GIF. 🐱✨

Happy coding! 💻🎉
